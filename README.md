## User Story

AS AN avid traveller,
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection,
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## General-Info

Budget App that tracks funds with online and offline access. The frontend UI was completed beforehand, and my coding contribution was the backend files. This project employs a service worker and a webmanifest to ensure offline funcionality, caching, and the ability to install as a progressive web app. These performance properties were all discussed week 18 topics, and this budget tracker was a culmination of that knowledge.

## Instructions

To successfully run this application, the user should first clone the repository into a local file and run npm install. Using the local console, user will run "npm i" on the included dependencies. After, run "npm run start" and on your local browser, type in "localhost:3000." Alternatively, the deployed application can be visited at "https://quiet-shore-35700.herokuapp.com/." This will bring up the UI where funds can be added or subtracted. Going into the developer tools under

## Motivation

Learning how to cache
This project helped me to practice MongoDB and Mongoose schemas which were two new concepts learned this past week. Focusing my efforts on backend functionality and learning the syntax of JavaScript routes. I benefitted from the increased practice on NoSql and pushing projects to Heroku.

## Future Functionality

For the future adding various aspects and addons to Chart.js would be helpful, especially for someone using this application consistently. More practice on routes and syncing up database information would also help expand the application.
